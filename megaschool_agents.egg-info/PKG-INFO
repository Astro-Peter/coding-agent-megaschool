# Megaschool Coding Agents

Skeleton implementation of planner, coder, verifier, and reviewer agents for the SDLC task.

## Quick start

These agents run locally and react to issue comments and PR updates. Configure
your `.env` file, then run the local watchers.

```bash
pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values.
./scripts/run_local_watcher.sh
./scripts/run_local_pr_watcher.sh
```

To replan from an issue comment, add `/plan` and the planner workflow will post a new plan.
